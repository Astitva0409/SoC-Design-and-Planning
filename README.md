# SoC-Design-and-Planning
<br>
Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we will delve into the process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file using the OpenLane ASIC flow. The flow is composed of several key steps, starting with an RTL file and culminating in a GDS file.

Package
In any embedded board we have seen, the part of the board we consider as the chip is only the PACKAGE of the chip which is nothing but a protective layer or packet bound over the actual chip and the actual manufatured chip is usually present at the center of a package wherein, the connections from package is fed to the chip by WIRE BOUND method which is none other than basic wired connection.
