# SoC-Design-and-Planning
<br>
Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we will delve into the process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file using the OpenLane ASIC flow. The flow is composed of several key steps, starting with an RTL file and culminating in a GDS file.
## Lessons Learned

Understanding the RTL to GDS Flow:

1. Grasped the end-to-end process of converting a high-level hardware description to a physical ASIC layout.
Recognized the importance of each step in the flow, from synthesis to sign-off.

2. Synthesis:

Learned how RTL is converted to a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries.
Identified the different views of cells (Liberty, HDL, SPICE, Layout).

3. Floor and Power Planning:
Understood the significance of floor planning in chip partitioning and I/O pad placement.

#### Package

* In any embedded board we have seen, the part of the board we consider as the chip is only the ***PACKAGE*** of the chip which is nothing but a protective layer or packet bound over the actual chip and the actual manufatured chip is usually present at the center of a package wherein, the connections from package is fed to the chip by ***WIRE BOUND*** method which is none other than basic wired connection.
